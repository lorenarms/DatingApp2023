<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
<p> This project was built while following a course online. The course guided students through development process, using best practices for clean code and the latest methodologies in designing applications. The entire SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) was exemplified in the course, including testing, deployment, and support. The project took about six weeks to complete.
</p>

### Why did I build this?
<p> As a software developer I am always looking to learn new strategies and frameworks to add to my toolbox. This course offered the opportunity to pair a framework I know well (ASP.NET) with a framework that I was still unfamiliar with (Angular). Throughout the development of this project I also learned a variety of third party libraries that add user-friendly functionality to the application, and strategies that I can and have used in various other projects. 
</p>
<p> Being someone who enjoys learning through "doing", this course offered a lot of opportunity to learn as I built. Additionally, just about ever part of the project proved to have some sort of challenge to it in regards to libraries that didn't load properly, code that resulted in errors, or other such problems. These gave me the opportunity to work through common issues that developers often face, without having a specific "solution" to fall back on. Overall, the course taught me best strategies for implementing Angular into C# API's when developing Web Applications.

### Built With

The project was built in Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code. It made use of SQLite for development and Postgres for database deployment. It also utilized Docker for deployment to fly.io.

A variety of third-party libraries were also used, such as ngx-bootstrap, timeago, SignalR, and Cloudinary (for photo uploads and serving).

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap
<p>There's still a lot left to add to the application, but for now I'm taking a break to work on other projects and apply what I've already learned here. If anyone would like to collaborate on any of the following items, please message me via my contact information at the <a href="#contact">bottom of this page</a>. I'm always open to working with other developers to create really cool stuff!
</p>

- [ ] Change password option
- [ ] Photo approval in Admin section
- [ ] Add mobile-friendly view
- [ ] Email confirmation option / TFA
- [ ] Responsive design
